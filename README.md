# Telecom-Data-Science-Applications
This project explores the application of data science in telecom operations, focusing on analyzing Mobile Phone Line Types (STATUS) and Customer Segmentation (SEGMENT1, SEGMENT2). The goal is to develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict customer behavior and segment customers effectively. The project includes data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and visualization using Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
# Key Features:
1- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing data formats.
2- Model Development: Implementation of KNN, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression Models.
3- Model Evaluation: Comparison of models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4- Visualization: Use of Matplotlib and Seaborn for data exploration and result presentation.
5- Recommendations: Insights and suggestions for improving model performance and telecom operations.
